# Product Recommendation API and simple front-end

A simple project containing an Node.js runtime environment API, which is responsible for returning an JSON object containing recommendation data for a reference product. The product ID has to be entered in the URL as an attribute, and it is hardcoded in the front-end static page on the root of the project (/index.html).

# Step-by-step first run
To render the carousel, you can follow these steps:
* Turn the server on by navigating to the 'api' folder and executing the following:
```console
user@example:product-recomendation$ cd api
user@example:product-recomendation/api$ nodejs app.js
```
* Simply open the 'index.html' on the root of the project. You should see the page with a few products listed on a carousel on the bottom of the page.
