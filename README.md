# Product Recommendation API and simple front-end

A simple Node.js runtime environment API, which is responsible for returning an JSON object containing recommendation data for a reference product in order to be rendered in a HTML page.

# Step-by-step first run
To render the carousel, you can follow these steps:
* Turn the server on by navigating to the 'api' folder and executing the following:
```console
user@example:product-recomendation$ cd api
user@example:product-recomendation/api$ nodejs app.js
```
* Simply open the 'index.html' on the root of the project. You should see the page with a few products listed on a carousel on the bottom of the page.
